This project is meant to be a way for me to study VueJS while I'm unemployed and bored. Do not expect any consistency between time spent, or even any gitflow patterns, as I just code without thinking too much on what I am doing for the time being.

This project employs:

- Vite
- VueJS
- Typescript
- SCSS
- My meticulous way of thinking directories and organization.

Also, this is a redesign based on l3xis (https://l3xis.net/).
